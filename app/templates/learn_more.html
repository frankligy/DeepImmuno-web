        <h2>How to interpret immunogenicity score?</h2>
        <p class="lead">A high immunogenicity score indicates increased confidence that the denoted peptide-HLA complex will trigger a T cell response, 
            compared to another peptide with a lower immunogenicity score. However, it does not necessarily reflect the actual degree of immunogenicity, 
            due to a lack of TCR sequence diversity information for a given individual. Specifically, the immunogenicity score reflects confidence based on experimental 
            evidence of for immunogenicity in the training data. For example, if a single peptide (peptide-1) produced an immune response in 40 out of 40 experiments, 
            it will result in a higher confidence observation than another peptide (peptide-2) that results in immune response 1 out of 6 experiments. 
            DeepImmunoCNN uses a beta-binomial model to incorporate this evidence when deriving an immunogenicity potential from the training data. 
            Hence, the output value reflects the confidence of the prediction.

        <h2>When should I check binding affnity option?</h2>
        <p class="lead"> It is always good to check it for a comprehensive understanding of the results, however, the only downside of checking it is that, it will
            require addtional computing time (30-60s) because we are calling an external package mhcflurry. A successful CD8+ immune response requires two step: 
            (1) First the peptide has to be presented by HLA allele, (2) Then the HLA-peptide complex needs to be able to trigger T cell response. In our training 
            dataset, all the immunogenic peptides are HLA-bound, but for some of the unseen HLA-peptide complex, DeepImmuno-CNN sometimes may generate a high immunogenicity
            score even though this peptide is very likely not able to bind with cognate HLA allele. In order to circumvent this problem, checking binding affnity can offer a better
            intuition of how to interprete the result.

    <div class="row">
        <h2>Why there's a Caveat beside my queried HLA allele?</h2>
        <p class="lead">The HLA queried may produce unreliable results as it is less-studied with insufficient training data instances to reliably infer its immunogenicity.
